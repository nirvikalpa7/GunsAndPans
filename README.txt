// I tried to use the best practices for writing code, however, the code is far from perfect: 
// in the code you can find magic numbers, a wide variety of data types and STL and portable 
// integer types, and old C types and OpenGL and Windows types, raw pointers and arrays are 
// also found. The game does not use any cool lighting, shadows or shaders. All this can be 
// added to the second version of the game, OpenGL itself supports it. The system of checking 
// the correctness of parameters and states is also probably not ideal. But the code is commented, 
// its namespace is used in the game, the code is divided into translation units, OOP and 
// polymorphism are used. I also tried to keep the KISS principle in mind when developing. 
// Mathematical operations were also not heavily optimized in this game, since the performance 
// problem is not acute.
